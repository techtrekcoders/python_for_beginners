    "  1. **Lexical Analysis**: Breaks the code into tokens (smallest units like keywords, identifiers, etc.).\n",
    "  2. **Parsing**: Analyzes the token sequence to build a syntax tree (structure of the code).\n",
    "  3. **Compilation**: Translates the syntax tree into bytecode (.pyc files).\n",
    "  4. **Execution**: Executes the bytecode using the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)."
